Redqueue is a light weight queue server that speaks memcache protocol
and provides persistent queue based on log. It is writen in python
using the high performance tornado frameworks, currently all the
functions are in a single file which contains only less than 300 lines
of effective code.

Redqueue is free and unencumbered public domain software.

== Install and Run
 Install tornado and (optional) python-memcached for client testing
 
 Get the source from 
 git@github.com:superisaac/redqueue.git
 
 Install
 % python setup.py install

 Make the log dir
 % mkdir -p log

 Run the server
 % redqueue_server.py
 
 For more options please run
 % redqueue_server.py --help

== Reserve/delete mode
   Now the program is able to behave like beanstalk to handle client crash, yet it uses memcached protocol
    >>> mc.set('abc', 123)
    >>> mc.set('config:reserv', 1)
    >>> mc.get('abc')
    >>> mc.get('abc')  # It must be None
    >>> mc.delete('abc')

    If client crashed or even server crashed, the key 'abc''s value
    123 is recycled again to queue.
