Redqueue is a light weight queue server that speaks memcache protocol
and provides persistent queue based on log. It is writen in python
using the high performance tornado frameworks, currently all the
functions are in a single file which contains only less than 300 lines
of effective code.

Redqueue is free and unencumbered public domain software.
